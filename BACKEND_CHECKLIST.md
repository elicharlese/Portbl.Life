# Backend & Frontend Development Checklist


This checklist will guide the backend and frontend development for your application, ensuring robust, production-ready features, seamless integration, and deployment best practices. The stack includes Next.js (React TS), Supabase, Vercel, and Rust Solana SDK for blockchain features.
## 0. Frontend Functionality & Integration
- [x] **Component Integration**: Ensure all UI components (Header, Footer, MegaMenu, ProductGrid, ProductGallery, CartSummary, CryptoPayment, etc.) are connected to backend APIs and display dynamic data.
- [x] **State Management**: Use React context/hooks or a state library for cart, user, and global state. Sync with backend where needed.
- [x] **Authentication Flows**: Implement sign-in, sign-up, password reset, and protected routes using Supabase Auth. Ensure UI reflects auth state.
- [x] **Account Management**: Enable users to update profile, addresses, view orders, manage wishlist, and track shipments from the account dashboard.
- [x] **Product & Collection Pages**: Fetch and display product details, variants, reviews, upsells, and related products. Implement collection filters, sorting, and pagination.
- [x] **Cart & Checkout**: Add, update, and remove items from cart. Persist cart for logged-in users. Integrate shipping calculation and order review steps. Show payment options (Stripe, Crypto).
- [x] **Payment UI**: Integrate Stripe and CryptoPayment components. Display payment status, errors, and confirmations. Handle Solana/crypto payment flows with real-time feedback.
- [x] **Order Confirmation & History**: Show order confirmation after checkout. Allow users to view past orders and order details.
- [x] **Reviews & Ratings**: Allow users to submit and view reviews. Display average ratings and review moderation status.
- [x] **Search & Navigation**: Implement product search with suggestions and filters. Ensure navigation is intuitive and responsive.
- [x] **Content Pages**: Render FAQ, Contact, About, and other static/dynamic pages. Integrate contact form with backend.
- [x] **Loading & Error States**: Show skeletons/loaders and user-friendly error messages for all async actions.
- [x] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure all pages and components are fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Follow a11y best practices (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.).
- [ ] **SEO & Metadata**: Set up dynamic titles, meta tags, Open Graph, and structured data for all pages.
- [ ] **Analytics**: Integrate Vercel Analytics or other tools for tracking user behavior and performance.
- [ ] **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for components, pages, and flows (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress).
