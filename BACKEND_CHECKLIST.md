# Backend & Frontend Development Checklist


This checklist will guide the backend and frontend development for your application, ensuring robust, production-ready features, seamless integration, and deployment best practices. The stack includes Next.js (React TS), Supabase, Vercel, and Rust Solana SDK for blockchain features.
## 0. Frontend Functionality & Integration
- [ ] **Component Integration**: Ensure all UI components (Header, Footer, MegaMenu, ProductGrid, ProductGallery, CartSummary, CryptoPayment, etc.) are connected to backend APIs and display dynamic data.
- [ ] **State Management**: Use React context/hooks or a state library for cart, user, and global state. Sync with backend where needed.
- [ ] **Authentication Flows**: Implement sign-in, sign-up, password reset, and protected routes using Supabase Auth. Ensure UI reflects auth state.
- [ ] **Account Management**: Enable users to update profile, addresses, view orders, manage wishlist, and track shipments from the account dashboard.
- [ ] **Product & Collection Pages**: Fetch and display product details, variants, reviews, upsells, and related products. Implement collection filters, sorting, and pagination.
- [ ] **Cart & Checkout**: Add, update, and remove items from cart. Persist cart for logged-in users. Integrate shipping calculation and order review steps. Show payment options (Stripe, Crypto).
- [ ] **Payment UI**: Integrate Stripe and CryptoPayment components. Display payment status, errors, and confirmations. Handle Solana/crypto payment flows with real-time feedback.
- [ ] **Order Confirmation & History**: Show order confirmation after checkout. Allow users to view past orders and order details.
- [ ] **Reviews & Ratings**: Allow users to submit and view reviews. Display average ratings and review moderation status.
- [ ] **Search & Navigation**: Implement product search with suggestions and filters. Ensure navigation is intuitive and responsive.
- [ ] **Content Pages**: Render FAQ, Contact, About, and other static/dynamic pages. Integrate contact form with backend.
- [ ] **Loading & Error States**: Show skeletons/loaders and user-friendly error messages for all async actions.
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure all pages and components are fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Follow a11y best practices (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, color contrast, etc.).
- [ ] **SEO & Metadata**: Set up dynamic titles, meta tags, Open Graph, and structured data for all pages.
- [ ] **Analytics**: Integrate Vercel Analytics or other tools for tracking user behavior and performance.
- [ ] **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for components, pages, and flows (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress).

## 1. Project Setup (Backend)
- [ ] **Monorepo/Directory Structure**: Organize backend and frontend code for clarity (e.g., `/api`, `/blockchain`, `/lib`, `/prisma` if using ORM).
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Securely manage secrets (Supabase keys, Solana RPC URLs, etc.) using `.env.local` and Vercel environment settings.
- [ ] **TypeScript Config**: Ensure strict typing and type safety across backend code.

## 2. API & Serverless Functions (Backend)
- [ ] **Next.js API Routes**: Implement RESTful endpoints for all frontend needs (products, cart, checkout, user, orders, reviews, etc.).
- [ ] **Authentication**: Integrate Supabase Auth (email/password, OAuth, magic links). Protect sensitive endpoints.
- [ ] **Authorization**: Role-based access for users/admins (e.g., order management, product CRUD).
- [ ] **Validation**: Use Zod or similar for input validation on all endpoints.
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses and logging.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of public endpoints.

## 3. Database (Supabase/Postgres)
- [ ] **Schema Design**: Tables for users, products, orders, reviews, addresses, wishlists, etc.
- [ ] **Migrations**: Use Supabase migration tools for schema changes.
- [ ] **Relations**: Foreign keys and indexes for performance.
- [ ] **Seed Data**: Scripts for initial data (products, categories, etc.).
- [ ] **Row Level Security**: Enable and test RLS policies for user data.

## 4. Product & Collection Logic (Backend)
- [ ] **Product CRUD**: Admin endpoints for creating, updating, deleting products and collections.
- [ ] **Product Details**: Fetch by slug/ID, including images, variants, specifications, reviews, upsells, and suggestions.
- [ ] **Collection Filters**: Backend logic for filtering, sorting, and paginating products.
- [ ] **Search**: Full-text search for products and collections.

## 5. Cart & Checkout (Backend)
- [ ] **Cart API**: Add, update, remove items; persist cart for logged-in users.
- [ ] **Shipping Calculation**: Logic for shipping rates (standard, expedited, international) as per `/shipping/page.tsx`.
- [ ] **Order Placement**: Endpoint to create orders, validate stock, and trigger confirmation emails.
- [ ] **Order Review**: Endpoint to fetch order summary for review step.
- [ ] **Order History**: User endpoint to fetch past orders.

## 6. Payment Integrations (Backend)
- [ ] **Stripe Integration**: Secure payment intent creation, webhook handling for order status updates.
- [ ] **Crypto Payments (Solana SDK)**:
    - [ ] Rust-based Solana program for payment address generation and transaction validation.
    - [ ] API endpoint to generate payment instructions and verify on-chain payments.
    - [ ] Webhook or polling to confirm payment and update order status.
    - [ ] Support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, Solana (see `CryptoPayment.tsx`).

## 7. User Account & Profile (Backend)
- [ ] **Profile Management**: Endpoints for updating user info, addresses, password reset, etc.
- [ ] **Wishlist**: Add/remove products, fetch wishlist.
- [ ] **Order Tracking**: Endpoint for tracking shipment status.

## 8. Reviews & Ratings (Backend)
- [ ] **Review Submission**: Authenticated endpoint for posting reviews.
- [ ] **Review Moderation**: Admin endpoint for approving/removing reviews.
- [ ] **Average Rating Calculation**: Logic for product ratings (see `ProductReviews`).

## 9. Content & Pages (Backend)
- [ ] **FAQ, Contact, About**: Endpoints for dynamic content if managed via CMS or database.
- [ ] **Contact Form**: Endpoint to send messages to support (email integration or Supabase function).

## 10. Admin Panel (Optional, Backend)
- [ ] **Admin Endpoints**: For managing products, orders, users, reviews, and site content.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Restrict access to admin users only.

## 11. Blockchain Integrations (Rust Solana SDK, Backend)
- [ ] **Solana Program**: Write, test, and deploy a Rust program for payment validation.
- [ ] **API Bridge**: Expose Solana program logic via Next.js API routes (using Node bindings or serverless functions).
- [ ] **Security**: Validate all on-chain interactions and sanitize inputs.

## 12. Testing (Backend)
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: For all backend logic (Jest, Rust tests for Solana).
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end tests for API endpoints.
- [ ] **Mocking**: Use mock data for external services (Stripe, Solana, Supabase) in tests.

## 13. CI/CD & Deployment (Backend)
- [ ] **GitHub Actions**: Lint, test, and build on PRs and main branch.
- [ ] **Vercel Deployment**: Connect repo, set environment variables, and enable preview/production deployments.
- [ ] **Production Build**: Ensure `next build` and Rust Solana program build succeed in CI.
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up error and performance monitoring (e.g., Sentry, Vercel Analytics).

## 14. Documentation (Backend)
- [ ] **API Docs**: Document all endpoints (OpenAPI/Swagger or markdown).
- [ ] **README Updates**: Add backend setup, environment, and deployment instructions.
- [ ] **Code Comments**: Maintain clear comments for complex logic.

## 15. Security & Compliance (Backend)

## Final Steps
- [ ] **Production Build**: Run `next build` and Rust Solana program build, fix all errors.
- [ ] **Push to GitHub**: Ensure all code is committed and pushed.
- [ ] **Deploy to Vercel**: Confirm production deployment is live and functional.
- [ ] **Smoke Test**: Manually test all critical flows (signup, checkout, payment, order, etc.).
